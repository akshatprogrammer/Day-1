# DAY 1
In this repository , We will discuss about Memory Hierarchy , Compilation Process, Logical and Physical Addresses 

# Memory Hierarchy
There are two types of Memory.
  * Primary -> Data is directly accessible by processor .
               Internal.
  * Secondary -> Accessibility be using in I/O module.
                 External.</br>

# COMPILATION PROCESS
 ### What is a compilation?
   The compilation is a process of converting the source code into object code. It is done with the help of the compiler. The compiler checks the source code for the        syntactical or structural errors, and if the source code is error-free, then it generates the object code.
   *** IDE -> Integrated Development Environment . </br>
The following are the phases through which our program passes before being transformed into an executable form: </br>
 * Preprocessor
 * Compiler
 * Assembler
 * Linker </br>

 # Physical and Logical Address 
 
 ## Physical Address
   The physical address refers to a location in the memory. It allows access to data in the main memory. A physical address is not directly accessible to the user program hence, a logical address needs to be mapped to it to make the address accessible. This mapping is done by the MMU. Memory Management Unit(MMU) is a hardware component responsible for translating a logical address to a physical address.
   
## Logical Address
  A logical address or virtual address is an address that is generated by the CPU during program execution. A logical address doesn't exist physically. The logical address is used as a reference to access the physical address.
